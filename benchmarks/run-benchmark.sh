## Quick Comparison

| Metric | BLS | Ringtail | Ratio |
|--------|-----|----------|-------|
| Signature Size | 96 bytes | 13.4 KB | 140x |
| Network Traffic (10 parties) | 960 bytes | 6.2 MB | 6,458x |
| Gas Cost | 150K | 7.5M | 50x |
| Quantum Resistant | No | Yes | âœ… |

## Recommendations

### Use Ringtail For:
- Treasury operations (> $10M)
- Long-term asset locks (> 10 years)
- Regulatory compliance requiring PQ security

### Continue Using BLS For:
- All user transactions
- Consensus operations
- High-frequency operations

## Cost Analysis

For 1000 operations/day:
- BLS: ~$1,095/year (storage + network + gas)
- Ringtail: ~$54,750/year (storage + network + gas)

For 10 operations/day (treasury only):
- BLS: ~$11/year
- Ringtail: ~$548/year (acceptable for high-value operations)
