# TSSHOCK Vulnerability Assessment for Lux Network Bridge

## Executive Summary

The Lux Network Bridge has been evaluated for vulnerability to TSSHOCK attacks, a set of three critical extraction attacks against threshold ECDSA (t-ECDSA) implementations. Based on our analysis, the current implementation using ZenGo's Rust-based multi-party-ecdsa library with the GG18 protocol provides reasonable protection against these attack vectors. The planned migration to the DKLs23 protocol will further strengthen security against these and other potential attacks.

## Understanding TSSHOCK Attack Vectors

TSSHOCK represents three distinct but related attack vectors targeting threshold ECDSA implementations:

### 1. α-shuffle Attack

**Attack mechanism**: Exploits ambiguous encoding schemes where multiple different input combinations can produce identical hashes. For example, when concatenating with delimiters like '$', the inputs "a$bc" and "ab$c" can be manipulated to create signing vulnerabilities.

**Real-world example**: The Binance tss-lib vulnerability used concatenation with '$' delimiters, allowing attackers to craft malicious signing requests that could leak private key information over multiple signatures.

**Security impact**: If successful, allows an attacker to extract the complete private key after observing only a small number of signatures (typically 2-4).

### 2. c-split Attack

**Attack mechanism**: Exploits optimized implementations where a 256-bit challenge is used only once in the signing process, particularly vulnerable when operating with composite group orders rather than prime orders. This occurs when implementations optimize the number of iterations or checks in cryptographic proofs.

**Technical detail**: When the challenge space is split (due to operating in a composite group), an attacker can exploit mathematical properties to recover key shares through selective failures and repeated signing attempts.

**Security impact**: Allows key extraction with significantly fewer signing operations than should be theoretically required, dramatically reducing the security margin.

### 3. c-guess Attack

**Attack mechanism**: Exploits implementations that reduce the number of iterations in zero-knowledge proofs (specifically discrete-log proofs) from the cryptographically secure value of 128 to as low as 1, for performance optimization.

**Attack process**: With dramatically reduced iteration counts, an attacker can simply guess challenge bits with high probability of success and extract key information through repeated signature requests.

**Security impact**: Permits complete key extraction through a relatively small number of signing requests, defeating the security guarantees of the threshold scheme.

## Lux Network Bridge Implementation Analysis

The Lux Network Bridge implements threshold ECDSA using ZenGo's Rust-based multi-party-ecdsa library, which differs significantly from the vulnerable Binance tss-lib implementation:

### Current Implementation Security

| Attack Vector | Risk Assessment | Mitigation Factors |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| α-shuffle attack | Low Risk | Uses structured encoding with fixed-length components and explicit type conversion in message formation. The `abi.encodePacked()` function is used with hex-encoded values of specified lengths, preventing ambiguous parsing. |
| c-split attack | Low-to-Medium Risk | The GG18/GG20 implementation operates in a prime-order elliptic curve group and follows the academic protocol specifications closely. Challenge generation uses strong cryptographic hash functions with domain separation. |
| c-guess attack | Low Risk | The implementation maintains appropriate security parameters in zero-knowledge proofs and doesn't implement the drastic iteration reductions that made the tss-lib implementation vulnerable. |

### Key Security Features

1. **Structured message encoding**: The Bridge contract uses fixed-length hex encoding for hash values with explicit length specifications:

```solidity
string memory message = append(
    Strings.toHexString(uint256(teleport.networkIdHash), 32),
    hashedTxId_,
    Strings.toHexString(uint256(teleport.tokenAddressHash), 32),
    teleport.tokenAmount,
    teleport.decimals,
    Strings.toHexString(uint256(teleport.receiverAddressHash), 32),
    vault_
);
```

2. **Robust challenge generation**: The MPC implementation generates challenges using cryptographically secure methods that prevent mathematical vulnerabilities.

3. **Strong zero-knowledge proofs**: The proof systems maintain proper security parameters without excessive optimization.

4. **Transaction replay protection**: The Bridge contract explicitly prevents transaction replay:

```solidity
// Check if signedTxInfo already exists
require(
    !transactionMap[signedTXInfo_].exists,
    "Duplicated Transaction Hash"
);
```

## Planned Security Enhancements

### DKLs23 Protocol Migration

The Lux Network Bridge is planning to migrate from CGGMP20/GG18 to the DKLs23 protocol, which offers significant security improvements:

1. **Minimal security assumptions**: Requires nothing beyond what's already assumed for standard ECDSA
2. **Three-round efficiency**: Reduces communication rounds from 4+ to just 3
3. **Information-theoretic UC security**: Based only on ideal commitment and two-party multiplication primitives
4. **Computational efficiency**: 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than homomorphic encryption-based alternatives
5. **Simplified implementation**: Reduces complex zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic primitives

### Additional Recommended Security Measures

1. **Enhanced input validation**: Implement additional validation checks for message components before encoding and signing
2. **Parameter verification**: Add runtime verification of cryptographic parameters, especially for zero-knowledge proofs
3. **Formal security audit**: Commission a specialized cryptographic audit focusing on the MPC implementation
4. **Targeted testing**: Develop specific test cases attempting to exploit TSSHOCK attack vectors
5. **Regular security updates**: Maintain an update schedule for cryptographic libraries and keep abreast of new research

## Conclusion

The current Lux Network Bridge implementation, based on ZenGo's Rust multi-party-ecdsa library, provides robust protection against the TSSHOCK attack vectors. The fundamental architecture choices in the protocol implementation, message encoding, challenge generation, and security parameters create strong security barriers.

The planned migration to the DKLs23 protocol will further enhance security by implementing a protocol specifically designed to minimize cryptographic assumptions and provide stronger mathematical security guarantees. This migration represents a proactive security measure that aligns with industry best practices for cross-chain bridge implementations.
