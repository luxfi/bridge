## 🔧 Infrastructure Services

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Lux ID (Casdoor) | 8000 | Unified authentication |
| KMS (Vault) | 8200 | Key management |
| NATS | 4223 | Message broker |
| Consul | 8501 | Service discovery |
| PostgreSQL | 5433 | Bridge database |
| Lux ID DB | 5434 | Auth database |

## 📈 Performance Improvements

- **No Docker overhead** - Native Go binaries
- **Direct integration** - Uses github.com/luxfi/mpc package
- **Better resource usage** - Reduced memory footprint
- **Faster startup** - No container initialization

## 🔍 Status Checks

```bash
# Check CI/CD status
./check-ci-status.sh

# Check MPC nodes

## 📝 Notes

- All changes are committed locally
- Network issues preventing push to GitHub
- CI/CD workflows updated and ready
- Documentation complete
- Release notes prepared

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If push continues to fail:
1. Check SSH connection: `ssh -T git@github.com`
2. Try HTTPS: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/luxfi/bridge.git`
3. Use patch files: `0001-*.patch` and `0002-*.patch` created
4. Contact repository admin for direct assistance
