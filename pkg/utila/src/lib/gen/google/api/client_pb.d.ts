/**
 * A definition of a client library method signature.
 *
 * In client libraries, each proto RPC corresponds to one or more methods
 * which the end user is able to call, and calls the underlying RPC.
 * Normally, this method receives a single argument (a struct or instance
 * corresponding to the RPC request object). Defining this field will
 * add one or more overloads providing flattened or simpler method signatures
 * in some languages.
 *
 * The fields on the method signature are provided as a comma-separated
 * string.
 *
 * For example, the proto RPC and annotation:
 *
 *   rpc CreateSubscription(CreateSubscriptionRequest)
 *       returns (Subscription) {
 *     option (google.api.method_signature) = "name,topic";
 *   }
 *
 * Would add the following Java overload (in addition to the method accepting
 * the request object):
 *
 *   public final Subscription createSubscription(String name, String topic)
 *
 * The following backwards-compatibility guidelines apply:
 *
 *   * Adding this annotation to an unannotated method is backwards
 *     compatible.
 *   * Adding this annotation to a method which already has existing
 *     method signature annotations is backwards compatible if and only if
 *     the new method signature annotation is last in the sequence.
 *   * Modifying or removing an existing method signature annotation is
 *     a breaking change.
 *   * Re-ordering existing method signature annotations is a breaking
 *     change.

 *
 * If there is more than one scope, use a comma-separated string:

 * Example:
 *
 *   service Foo {
 *     option (google.api.oauth_scopes) = \
 *       "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,"
