Bridge monorepo for Lux Network.

## To run locally

Install `pnpm` [like so](https://pnpm.io/installation)

The usual scripts for a Next site, using `pnpm`
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Since "pnpm" is a finger twister, many people alias it to "pn". For example, with `bash`, put `alias pn='pnpm'` in `.bashrc`.
